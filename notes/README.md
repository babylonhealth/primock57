# notes
This folder contains consultation notes written by the consulting clinicians,
either during or shortly after each consultation. 

The notes are provided in JSON format, and each contains the following fields:
  - `day`: Consultation day
  - `consultation`: Consultation #
  - `presenting_complaint`: Patient's presenting complaint
  - `note`: Consultation note
  - `highlights`: List of clinician highlighted terms in the note.
(Clinicians were asked to highlight important medical information in their 
notes; this was not extensive, depending on whether time allowed.)
