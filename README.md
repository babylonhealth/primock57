# PriMock57

This repository contains the data and annotations described in the papers:
* [**PriMock57: A Dataset Of Primary Care Mock Consultations**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00333)
* [**Human Evaluation and Correlation with Automatic Metrics in Consultation Note Generation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00447)

The dataset consists of 57 mock medical primary care consultations held over 
5 days by 7 Babylon clinicians and 57 Babylon employees acting 
as patients, using case cards  with presenting complaints, symptoms, medical 
& general history etc. The data in this repository includes:
1) Audio recordings of the consultations (`audio` folder);
2) Manual utterance-level transcriptions of the recordings (`transcripts` folder);
3) Consultation notes written by the consulting clinicians (`notes` folder);
4) Human evaluation annotations & data (`human_eval_data` folder).

The `scripts` folder includes some data transformation scripts
(utterance extraction, transcript collation etc.)

More detailed descriptions are found in each folder's `README.md` files.
